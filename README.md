# Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Dataset

This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on a Twitter dataset using logistic regression and other NLP techniques. The dataset used in this project is the **Sentiment140** dataset, which contains labeled tweets. The goal is to classify tweets as positive or negative.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is downloaded from [Kaggle's Sentiment140 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140). It contains 1.6 million labeled tweets.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Kaggle API key (download and configure as `kaggle.json`)
- Required Python libraries: numpy, pandas, re, scikit-learn, nltk, and pickle

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-twitter.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-twitter

2. Install required libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Download the Sentiment140 dataset from Kaggle:
   kaggle datasets download -d kazanova/sentiment140

4. Extract the dataset:
   unzip sentiment140.zip

5. Copy your Kaggle API key (kaggle.json) to the appropriate location:

   mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
   cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
   chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json

## Project Structure

- `sentiment_analysis.py`: The main script containing the data processing, model training, and evaluation code.
- `requirements.txt`: Contains the list of dependencies required to run the project.
- `trained_model.sav`: Saved trained logistic regression model (optional).
- `README.md`: This file.

## How to Run

1. Execute the main script: python sentiment_analysis.py
2. 
3. The script will process the dataset, train a logistic regression model, evaluate the model, and print the accuracy scores.

4. You can save the trained model to a file for later use.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: The script includes data preprocessing steps such as stemming, tokenization, and removing non-alphabetic characters.
- Model Training: Logistic regression is used as the model for sentiment analysis.
- Model Evaluation: Accuracy score for both training and testing data is calculated and printed.

## Model Saving and Loading

- The trained model is saved to a file (`trained_model.sav`) and can be loaded back for predictions.

## Future Improvements

- Consider using other advanced models such as neural networks for better performance.
- Fine-tune hyperparameters of the model for optimal results.
- Add support for other languages and expand the dataset.
